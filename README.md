# train-ticket-booking

I want to board a train from London to France. The train ticket will cost $5.

1) Create an API where you can submit a purchase for a ticket. Details included in the receipt are:
   a) From, To, User , price paid.
   b) User should include first and last name, email address
3) The user is allocated a seat in the train. Assume the train has only 2 sections, section A and section B.
4) An API that shows the details of the receipt for the user
5) An API that lets you view the users and seat they are allocated by the requested section
6) An API to remove a user from the train
7) An API to modify a user's seat
